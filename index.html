              <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
              <p>
                Designed a complete Personal Portfolio Website with the use of
                Pure HTML and CSS. This website consists the various links to my
                social, methods to contact me personally , everything about me.
                <br />
                This website includes a few buttons which redirect the client to
                other linked webpages and also a ton of CSS styles to make it
                look awesome! <br />
                The website has been temporarily being hosted on Github but
                It'll soon be shifted to a permanant domain.

              <h2>AntiCheat.py</h2>
              <p>
                AntiCheat.py is a python program developed to avoid the use of
                Unfair Means Conducted during Online Exams in the ongoing
                pandaemic. It consists of several libraries working together to
                solve it. A Speech-Recognition program would ensure that the
                student doesn't use any hands-free assisstant to look for
                answers, A motion detection makes sure that the student isn't
                peeping into a book kept nearby. Yet if the student used to be
                caught with any such mal-practices, the program would send the
                data along with time stamps to the invilgilator at the end of
                the test.

              <h2>Rock Paper Scissors Game</h2>
              <p>
                Rock Papers and Scissors is one thing we've all played in our
                childhood, but even today I can't get over it , so I made it on
                my favourite programming language - Python. The coding part of
                such a game is pretty easy so to level things up, I've added a
                User - Interface to it too!. The UI has been designed using the
                in-built Python Module Tkinter. The UI consists of a few buttons
                and different levels of difficulty to chose from.
